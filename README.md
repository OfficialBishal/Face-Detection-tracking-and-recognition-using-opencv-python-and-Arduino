# High Security Surveillance Camera |OpenCV-Python-Arduino|

This has three main features
1. Face Detection
2. Face tracking
3. Face Recognition

First of all to setup the environment, I have used Pyhton 3.7 and OpenCV to implement Haar Casscade.
I have kept comments inside the codes so it wil be easy to follow up; this is basic project that I did with the help of internet.

to install numpy just use command "pip install numpy". just replace numpy with whatever you require.

Dont forget to put the serial port according to your environment you are working on.

I have tried to make things as simple as possibile so if any problem do contact.

>> For beginners know what these are: OpenCV, Python, Haar Cascade, Arduino, Servo Motors, Greyscale, numpy...
